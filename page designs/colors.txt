#D6A99D
#FBF3D5
#D6DAC8
#9WAFAA


#FBF3D5 as the background provides a soft, neutral base
that's easy on the eyes and won't compete with your content
#9CAFAA as the navbar creates a nice contrast while
maintaining the earthy, calm aesthetic of the palette
The darker sage green navbar will stand out clearly
against the light background, making navigation obvious

You can use
#D6A99D (dusty rose) for accent elements, buttons, or hover states
#D6DAC8 (light sage) works well for subtle borders, cards, or secondary elements
